# pozyx-tag-class
A simple matlab class created to store and parse range measurments from a pozyx device transmitted over ROS

In its current state, this repository is being used to store an experiment specific implementation of a class responsible for handling range measurments to a pozyx tag over ROS. The ROS publisher provided by pozyx for the range measurments has been 'slightly' modifed and those modification may be reflected in this matlab class. 

In the future, hopefully, this will become a generalized class that can be used to quickly store and parse range measurments received by a pozyx node.
